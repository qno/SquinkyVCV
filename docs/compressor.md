## About Comp

It is a very normal compressor / limiter. Most of the controls should be very familiar.

It is fully polyphonic, although all channels will have the same settings.

The "Limiter" is an infinite ratio hard-knee compressor. It is also implemented much differently than the other ratios. Consequently it uses almost no CPU when processing 16 channels. So if you want to "Squash everything" it's a very economical setting.

It has fixed (preset) compression ratios and knee width. Using presets like this allows Comp to have very high audio quality without using much CPU.

It also has a web/dry mix to allow "parallel compression", which is very stylish right now.

## Some uses for Comp

Taming the mix - use on the mixer output. Typically you would use a fairly subtle amount of compression.

Take the drums sit together better. Make a sub=mix of the drums and run the sub=mix through Comp. Anything from a subtle compression to extreme squishing can sound good.

If different synth voices are varying too much in volume, compress each of them a bit.

Completely squish the output of all your filter or synth voices before they go into a VCA.
