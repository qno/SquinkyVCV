# Basic VCF

Basic VCF is designed to have some unusual sonic options and to use very little CPU. Most VCFs use a lot of CPU to try to unsure that they sound good when over-driven. Basic VCF, on the other hand, doesn't sound very good if it's over-driven, so we a) made it difficult to overdrive, and b) added some other unique options to take the sounds in some directions other filters may not go.

Basic VCF offers a choice of 12 or 24dB filter, and a choice of filter response. The 12dB setting, while not as "fat" as the typical 25dB ladder filter, is often a welcome break from more aggressive and fatter filters.

Basic VCF also has a unique control called "R". This works in any of the 24dB modes, and acts to "spread apart" the 24dB resonant peaks into two 12dB resonant peaks.

Note to testers: I'm not sure this R feature should be in here. It is a very important part of the other filter (F4)I'm working on now - this weaker implementation may just confuse the issues.

Because this VCF uses to little CPU compared to other, your can use very many of them. don't hesitate to use the all over the place if you feel like it.

## The gain structure.

Since filters can have large swings in level, any filter must grapple with gain issues and compromises. In the analog world, typically the "Moog" style filters would have a constant gain at the resonant frequency - and as the Q control was raised all the other frequencies were lowered. This was sometimes derisively refereed to as "bass suck". Other filters like the state-variable multimode filters (Omberheim SEM, Basic VCF) would naturally boost the resonant frequency, while the other frequencies stayed at the same level. This had no "bass suck", but could very easily overload.

Now in the digital world it is very easy for any filter to take any approach to gain vs. Q. In our stairway we include a knob called "bass" the have either gain rule, or anything in between.

In Basic VCF we did two things.

#1 is that even though we use a state variable filter, we keep the gain at resonance constant, like a Moog filter. We do this to keep the filter from distorting, which as we mentioned before doesn't sound good.

#2 is that we added a very aggressive limiter to the output of the filter. This let us turn off the "bass suck" without over-driving the filter. We thing is also sounds really cool. Just turn the limiter on, crank up the Q and sweet the filter. It's going to sound a lot different from most filters.

## The limiter

The limiter is not adjustable, if only has on/off. I has a fixed threshold of 5V, a fixed attack of 1 ms. and a fixed release of 100 ms. Being a limiter, the compression ratio in infinite.

## Controls

**Fc** Knob controls the center frequency of the filter. When R is turned up, Fc will move both of the peaks.

**Q** Filter resonance. Acts like other filters.

**R** increasing R breaks up the resonant peak into two resonant peaks. R is how far apart they are. Does not do anything with the 12dB filter setting.

**Limit** turns on the built in limiter.

**Mode** offers four choices: Lowpass, Bandpass, Highpass, and Notch.

**Topology** offers three choices, 12dB, 24dB, and Parallel. Not that the parallel is exactly the same as the 12dB, unless the R value is changed. then it will produce two peaks. The effect of "R" is more obvious with the parallel topology.
