# F2 VCF

F2 VCF is designed to have some unusual sonic options and to use very little CPU. Most VCFs use a lot of CPU to try to ensure that they sound good when over-driven. F2 VCF, on the other hand, doesn't sound very good if it's over-driven, so we a) made it difficult to overdrive, and b) added some other unique options to take the sounds in some directions other filters may not go.

F2 VCF offers a choice of 12 or 24dB filter, and a choice of filter response. The 12dB setting, while not as "fat" as the typical 24dB ladder filter, is often a welcome break from more aggressive and fatter filters. And in 24dB mode F2 will roll-off a little faster than the typical ladder filter.

F2 VCF also has a unique control called "R". This works in any of the 24dB modes, and acts to "spread apart" the 24dB resonant peaks into two 12dB resonant peaks.

Because this VCF uses to little CPU compared to others, your can use very many of them. Don't hesitate to use the all over the place if you feel like it. Or use a whole bunch of them in a single voice.

## The gain structure

Since filters can have large swings in level, any filter must grapple with gain issues and compromises. In the analog world, typically the "Moog" style filters would have a constant gain at the resonant frequency - and as the Q control was raised all the other frequencies were lowered. This was sometimes derisively refereed to as "bass suck". Other filters like the state-variable multimode filters (Oberheim SEM, F2 VCF) would naturally boost the resonant frequency, while the other frequencies stayed at the same level. This had no "bass suck", but could very easily overload.

Now in the digital world it is very easy for any filter to take any approach to gain vs. Q. In our Stairway ladder filter we include a knob called "bass" to give a choice of either gain rule, or anything in between.

In F2 VCF we did two things.

#1 is that even though we use a state variable filter, we keep the gain at resonance close to constant, like a Moog filter. We do this to keep the filter from distorting, which as we mentioned before doesn't sound good.

#2 is that we added a very aggressive limiter to the output of the filter. This let us turn off the "bass suck" without over-driving the filter. We think it also sounds really cool. Just turn the limiter on, crank up the Q and sweet the filter. It's going to sound a lot different from most filters.

## The limiter

The limiter is not adjustable, if only has on/off. It has a fixed threshold of 5V, a fixed attack of 1 ms. and a fixed release of 100 ms. Being a limiter, the compression ratio in infinite.

Note to testers: should I decrease the threshold and add some makeup gain, or is it squashed enough with these settings?

## Controls

**Fc** Knob controls the center frequency of the filter. When R is turned up, Fc will move both of the peaks.

**Q** Filter resonance. Acts like other filters.

**R** increasing R breaks up the resonant peak into two resonant peaks. R is how far apart they are. Does not do anything with the 12dB filter setting.

**Limit** turns on the built in limiter.

**Mode** offers four choices: Lowpass, Bandpass, Highpass, and Notch.

**Topology** offers four choices, 12dB, 24dB, Parallel, and Parallel difference. Note that the parallel is exactly the same as the 12dB, unless the R value is changed. Then it will produce two peaks. The effect of "R" is more obvious with the parallel topology.

Parallel difference mode is a little odd. Inside it's just subtracting the outputs of the two filters, but.... If R is set to zero, nothing will come out. This means you can gate the output using R. This is a little bit like an LPG in that the timbre will change as the volume shuts off.
